# AphisGeneralizablePestandPathogenModel
# This model is being established as a partnership between NC State University and the US Forest Service's APHIS program. 
# The goal is to build a generalizable framework for modeling pest and pathogen spread and introduction in both
# forest and agricultural ecosystems.
